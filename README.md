## humble - A frontend framework for Go

###What is humble?

We knew Go was the language we loved working in on the backend for our web applications, but what if we could build our *frontends* in Go too? humble is a  lightweight, modular framework for Go that has 3 main, modular pieces that work together and apart:

- Routing: 
	- Pointing URLs to different pages and partials (single page application), including query tokens
- UI Rendering: 
	- Easy to create/append/delete DOM elements to render common UI elements.
- Models: 
	- Keeping a JS object mapped to a RESTful API and performing easy CRUD actions

### Routes

A dynamic router that reads and builds URLs of the form "/#/my/favourite/page/{id}" with unlimited literal and query tokens that are passed to a function handler. The function handlers are written in idiomatic Go, mimicking the http.Handler syntax.

### Views

A easy way to wrap UI DOM elements that come up repeatedly or are modified extensively with JavaScript. Views are designed as Go interfaces and have to satisfy just 3 methods:

- *RenderHTML()* that gives back the HTML it is associated with.
- *GetID()* that gives it a unique ID (which can be auto-generated by including the included *humble.Identifier* type as an anonymous field)
- *OuterTag()* that gives the outer tag that the view HTML is wrapped in. This is necessary for easy referencing of the view element rendered in the DOM but can be any tag (custom or semantically neutral) that the user needs.

This allows:

- Easy create/append/delete of repeated View DOM elements.
- Easily adding event listeners to any DOM element within View.
- Organized view objects that control DOM with their own properties/methods

### Models

A very lightweight wrapper to make CRUD actions easy HTTP requests to a RESTful API endpoint. Models are designed as Go interfaces and have to satisfy just 2 methods:

- *RootURL()* that gives the REST API endpoint URL.
- *GetID()* that gives it a unique ID (which can be auto-generated by including the included *humble.Identifier* type as an anonymous field)

This allows:

- Easy CRUD actions that map to HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Organized model objects with their own properties/methods
